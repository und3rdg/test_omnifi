# The Task

We would like you to create a simple web application in the framework of your choice. The function of this app is to pull a feed of locations from an endpoint and show them as pins on a maps integration of your choosing.

Please note: Weâ€™d recommend a maximum of 4 hours on the task, even if it is not complete.  Code quality and structure is more important than a finished but rushed project - in particular, aim to follow the best practices of the particular coding libraries you are utilising.


## Requirements:

* Web application to run in Google Chrome on desktop and Safari on mobile
* Application loads the map data from an external endpoint (provided below)
* The app must display a map with a pin for each location in the remote JSON feed using latitude and longitude from the feed.
* Once a pin is tapped the popup should show the country name from the feed.
* You are allowed to use any 3rd party libraries you prefer to help carry out the task - please look to follow best practices around any 3rd party libraries you utilise
* If you want to use Google Maps for the integrations, use the API key ***************************************


## Stretch goal

* Provide a list of the pins separately within the app
* Allow the user to click on an item in the feed, centre the map and open the popup for that location


## Assets

The location feed is available at: https://************.amazonaws.com/****************/locations.json


## Submission

Share in a method that is convenient - ideally using Github or a different version control provider - aim to commit often and follow best practices around usage of this.


Thanks and good luck!
